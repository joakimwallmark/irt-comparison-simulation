# Instructions for replicating simulation study
- Run 0-scenario-setup.R to setup the simulated scenarios.
- Run 1-sim-setup.R to load scenarios from the previous step as well as some additional setup.
- Run 2-generate-data.R to simulate data.
- Run 3-fit-models.R to fit IRT models to simulated data.
- Run 4-compute-fit.R to compute performance measures.
- Run 5-arc-length-recovery.R to estimate standard errors and bias of different scoring methods.
- The code in 6-produce-plots-tables.R can be used to produce plots and tables of simulations results.
